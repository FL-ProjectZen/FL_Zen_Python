EXERCISES:  
===========
Write programs for below requirements:
Note:  While writing program, take your own scenario, follow naming conventions, coding practices 

A. EASY: (Beginner-friendly conceptual clarity)
------------------------------------------------
1. Check if 5 <= 5
2. Compare 3 <= 10
3. Verify if 4 + 1 <= 3 * 2

B. MEDIUM: (Deeper logic, multi-condition understanding)
--------------------------------------------------------
4. Given tasks_completed = 7, check if tasks_completed <= 10
5. Compare if len("Lab") <= len("Labs")
6. Check if the sum of [1,2,3] is <= the product of [1,1,2]

C. DIFFICULT: (Advanced reasoning + real engineering logic)
-----------------------------------------------------------
7. Validate employee experience exp <= required_exp for exp=3, required_exp=5
8. Compare two lists and check if len(list1) <= len(list2) for [1,2,3] and [1,2,3,4]
9. Compare (a - b) <= (a % b) for a=17, b=5
