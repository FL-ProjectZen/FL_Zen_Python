LECTURE LEVEL EXERCISES : 
=========================
Note:  While writing program, take your own scenario, follow naming conventions, coding practices 

A. EASY: (Beginner-friendly conceptual clarity)
================================================
1. Use = to assign values to two variables (for example, x and y) and print their values
2. Store the result of an addition (for example, a + b) into a variable using = and display the result
3. Create a counter variable with value 0, then update it using counter = counter + 10 and then counter += 5 and print the counter value after each update

B. MEDIUM: (Deeper logic, multi-condition understanding)
=============================================================
4. Simulate a wallet system where an initial balance is stored using = and then increased using += for a recharge operation
5. Maintain product stock in a shop using a variable stock; decrease it twice using -= to represent two separate sales and display the final stock
6. Create a score variable starting from 0 and update it using += for three different events like quiz, assignment, and project

C. DIFFICULT: (Advanced reasoning + real engineering logic)
=============================================================
7. A bank account starts with an initial balance stored using =
    Perform multiple operations using += for deposits and -= for withdrawals and display the final balance
8. A warehouse starts with a base stock
    Use += to add incoming shipments and -= to subtract damaged or returned items and print the final stock level
9. A fitness tracker starts with steps = 0
    Use += to add steps from morning, afternoon, and evening walks and then use -= to adjust for incorrectly counted steps and display the corrected step count

LECTURE LEVEL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

A. EASY: (Beginner-friendly conceptual clarity)
================================================ 
1. Explain how the assignment operator (=) stores values in variables and why Python evaluates the right-hand side before assignment
2. What is the purpose of += and -= operators and how do they improve code readability compared to long-form expressions like x = x + 5
3. Describe how *= and /= help perform arithmetic updates in a shorter, cleaner expression and give a simple scenario where they are useful

B.MEDIUM: (Deeper logic, multi-operator understanding)
======================================================
4. How does Python internally handle chained updates when multiple assignment operators like +=, -=, and *= are used in a sequence
5. Explain how assignment operators help maintain state in systems such as counters, accumulators, balances, or iterative loops
6. Why is it important to understand data types when using operators like /= and //=, and how can assignment operations lead to type changes

C.DIFFICULT: (Advanced reasoning + real engineering logic)
============================================================
7. In a financial application, how do operators like += and -= support auditability and incremental updates while reducing calculation errors
8. Explain how compound assignment operators help optimize performance inside loops for large-scale data processing or simulations
9. In a real-world workflow like inventory management, how do +=, -=, *=, and %= support dynamic state tracking across multiple operations and time intervals
