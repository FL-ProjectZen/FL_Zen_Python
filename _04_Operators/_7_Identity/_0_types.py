Identity Operators:
=====================
 - Identity operators check whether two variables refer to the same object in memory, not whether they simply hold the same value.

Python gives two identity operators:
    
    is
    is not
    
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|    
| S.No | Operator | Meaning                      | What It Checks                                               | Example                                   | Output |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|    
| 1    | is       | Identity comparison          | Checks if two variables refer to the same object in memory   | a = 10; b = 10; print(a is b)             | True   |
| 2    | is not   | Negative identity comparison | Checks if two variables refer to different objects in memory | x = [1,2] y = [1,2] print(x is not y)     | True   |
