LECTURE LEVEL EXERCISES : 
=========================
Note:  While writing program, take your own scenario, follow naming conventions, coding practices 

A. EASY: (Beginner-friendly conceptual clarity)
------------------------------------------------
1. Evaluate a + b, a - b, and a * b for a = 5, b = 3, then compare the results using <, >, and ==
2. Compute 10 / 2, 10 // 3, and 10 % 3, then check if the results are < 5, >= 3, and != 4
3. For numbers x = 4, y = 2, calculate x ** y, x + y, and x - y, then verify conditions using >, <=, and !=

B. MEDIUM: (Deeper logic, multi-condition understanding)
--------------------------------------------------------
4. Given a list [10, 20, 30], compute the sum, average (sum/len), and modulus (sum % 7), then check (sum > avg), (avg <= modulus), and (modulus != sum)
5. Using strings "Python" and "Code", compare lengths, then check if (len1 + len2) > (len1 * len2), (len1 - len2) <= 2, and (len1 != len2)
6. For a = 7, b = 3, evaluate (a * b), (a + b), (a % b), then compare them using <, >=, and ==

C. DIFFICULT: (Advanced reasoning + real engineering logic)
------------------------------------------------------------
7. Using salary metrics: base = 45000, bonus = 8000, deductions = 5000
    Compute total = base + bonus - deductions, expected = 50000, and check (total < expected), (total != base), (expected >= total)

8. For lists A = [2, 4, 6] and B = [3, 5, 7], 
    compute -> sumA, sumB, difference (sumB - sumA), and 
    test    -> (sumA < sumB), (sumB != sumA), (difference >= 3)

9. For a = 5, b = 2, compute
    expr1 = a ** b, expr2 = a * b, expr3 = a + b, then validate (expr1 > expr2), (expr2 != expr3), (expr3 <= expr1)
