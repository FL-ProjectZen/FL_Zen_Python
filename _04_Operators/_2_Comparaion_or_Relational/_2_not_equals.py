EXERCISES:  
===========
Write programs for below requirements:
Note:  While writing program, take your own scenario, follow naming conventions, coding practices 

A. EASY: (Beginner-friendly conceptual clarity)
------------------------------------------------
1. Check whether two numbers 10 and 20 are not equal using !=
2. Write a condition that checks if the string "Python" is not equal to "python"
3. Compare 5 + 3 and 10 - 2 using != and print the result

B. MEDIUM: (Deeper logic, multi-condition understanding)
---------------------------------------------------------
4. Given eid = 101 and user_input_eid = 102, check if they are not equal and print "Mismatch" if true
5. Create a program that checks if the length of "Ferilion" is not equal to the length of "Labs"
6. Compare the sum of a list [10, 20, 30] with the product of [2, 3, 5] using !=

C. DIFFICULT: (Advanced reasoning + real engineering logic)
-----------------------------------------------------------
7. Given emp_salary = 45000 and expected_min_salary = 50000, use != inside a decision block to validate salary mismatch
8. Write code to compare two lists [1,2,3] and [1,2,3,4] using != and print "Lists differ" if true
9. Combine arithmetic + comparison:
    Check if (a * b) != (a + b) for a = 7, b = 3, and print the mismatch result
