LECTURE LEVEL EXERCISES : 
=========================
Note:  While writing program, take your own scenario, follow naming conventions, coding practices 

A. EASY: (Beginner-friendly conceptual clarity)
------------------------------------------------
1. Evaluate a + b, a - b, and a * b for a = 5, b = 3
2. Compute 10 / 2, 10 // 3, and 10 % 3 for any chosen values
3. For numbers x = 4, y = 2, calculate x ** y, x + y, and x - y

B. MEDIUM: (Deeper logic, multi-condition understanding)
--------------------------------------------------------
4. Given a list [10, 20, 30], compute the sum, average (sum/len), and modulus (sum % 7)
5. Using strings "Python" and "Code", compute their lengths, then derive (len1 + len2), (len1 * len2), and (len1 - len2)
6. For a = 7, b = 3, evaluate (a * b), (a + b), (a % b)

C. DIFFICULT: (Advanced reasoning + real engineering logic)
-----------------------------------------------------------
7. Using salary metrics: base = 45000, bonus = 8000, deductions = 5000
    Compute total = base + bonus - deductions and any other arithmetic variation you choose
8. For lists A = [2, 4, 6] and B = [3, 5, 7], 
    compute -> sumA, sumB, difference (sumB - sumA)
9. For a = 5, b = 2, compute
    expr1 = a ** b, expr2 = a * b, expr3 = a + b

LECTURE LEVEL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS :
====================================

A. EASY: (Beginner-friendly conceptual clarity)
------------------------------------------------
1. Explain how operators like +, -, and * are used to derive new values from existing variables
2. Describe how /, //, and % differ when used to divide or break down numbers
3. Explain how exponentiation (**) helps create derived values like powers or scaling factors

B. MEDIUM: (Deeper logic, multi-operator understanding)
-------------------------------------------------------
4. How does combining +, -, %, and // help in real-world scenarios like billing, splitting, and grouping data
5. Why might multiplying lengths of values change complexity, size, or behavior in an arithmetic computation
6. Explain how mixing operations like *, %, and + in the same expression relies on operator precedence

C. DIFFICULT: (Advanced reasoning + real engineering logic)
-----------------------------------------------------------
7. Explain how arithmetic formulas such as salary = base + bonus - deductions are used in business logic
8. How do arithmetic transformations like sum(list), diff(listB - listA), and scaling values help in analytics workloads
9. How would you decide whether to use **, *, or + when designing a calculation pipeline involving multiple steps
