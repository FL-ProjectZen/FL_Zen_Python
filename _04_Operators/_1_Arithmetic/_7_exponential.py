EXERCISES:  logic involves all operators
===========
Write programs for below requirements:
Note:  While writing program, take your own scenario, follow naming conventions, coding practices 

A. EASY: (Beginner-friendly conceptual clarity)
------------------------------------------------
1. Compute 3 ** 3.
2. Square of 14 using exponent.
3. (2 + 3) ** 2.

B. MEDIUM: (Deeper logic, multi-condition understanding)
---------------------------------------------------------
4. Bacteria doubles every hour → population after 6 hours (2⁶).
5. Compute (5 ** 2) + (20 // 3).
6. Value of 1.2 ** 3.

C. DIFFICULT: (Advanced reasoning + real engineering logic)
-----------------------------------------------------------
7. Compound interest:
        Principal ₹10,000, rate 5%, 3 years → use exponent.
8. Evaluate (14 ** 2) - (24 % 5) + (64 // 3).
9. Computer science combo:
        “Total bitstrings of length n” = 2ⁿ.
    Find total for n = 10.
