To Summarize: 
============
I. Readable Code Mindset:
-------------------------
    1. Readability is the core of professional engineering; great code communicates intent clearly.
    2. Expressive naming removes guesswork and helps anyone understand the code instantly.
    3. Transparent, step-by-step logic makes debugging faster and data flow easier to trace.
    4. Consistent coding style aligns team members and avoids misinterpretation.
    5. Maintainable structures prevent future breakdowns and reduce effort during updates.
    6. Hardcoding is acceptable only for quick demos; real-world systems require dynamic inputs.
    7. Code should reflect end-to-end engineering flow (UI → Python → DB), not just console logic.
    8. Multi-line and single-line comments must be used to document reasoning and complex logic.
    9. Enterprise coding discipline builds production-ready habits expected from 3–5 YOE developers.
   10. Readable code is timeless: it should make sense even after months without revisiting it.

II. Test Scenario vs Test Case :
--------------------------------
    1. A test scenario describes what behavior needs to be validated without specific inputs.
    2. A test case defines exact inputs, expected outputs, and execution steps.
    3. Scenarios are high-level and broad; test cases are detailed and executable.
    4. Always extract scenarios first, then convert them into test cases.
    5. Scenario buckets (count, type, datatype, zero-handling) improve coverage and clarity.
    6. Each scenario bucket expands into concrete variations that capture all possibilities.
    7. Test cases attach specific values to each scenario to validate behavior accurately.
    8. This thinking pattern is used in TDD, unit testing, API testing, UI validation, and QA alignment.
    9. Requirements must be broken into dimensions to uncover hidden edge cases.
  10. Scenario-first thinking ensures developer–QA alignment and produces predictable, high-quality software.
