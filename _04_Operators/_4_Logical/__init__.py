LECTURE LEVEL EXERCISES : 
=========================
Note: While writing program, take your own scenario, follow naming conventions, coding practices 

A. EASY: (Beginner-friendly conceptual clarity)
================================================
1. Check if a number is positive and even using logical and
2. Verify if a user is eligible for entry if age >= 18 or has_parent_consent == True
3. Use logical not to reverse a Boolean value and print the output

B. MEDIUM: (Deeper logic, multi-condition understanding)
=============================================================
4. Validate login access using (username_correct and password_correct)
5. Check whether a student passes if (score >= 40 or grace_marks == True)
6. Combine not with and/or to form a condition like: access_granted = (is_employee or has_guest_pass) and not is_blocked

C. DIFFICULT: (Advanced reasoning + real engineering logic)
=============================================================
7. A loan is approved only if (income >= 50000 and cibil_score >= 700) or has_guarantor == True
    Write a program to check eligibility
8. A system sends an alert if (temperature > 50 or humidity > 80) and not system_in_maintenance
    Implement and print the result
9. A conference entry system grants access if (registered == True or vip_pass == True) and not blacklist_flag
    Validate and display whether the user is allowed

LECTURE LEVEL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

A. EASY: (Beginner-friendly conceptual clarity)
================================================ 
1. Explain how logical and ensures both conditions must be True before producing a True result
2. Describe how logical or helps evaluate fallback conditions when any one option is acceptable
3. What does logical not do, and why is it helpful in reversing or negating Boolean states

B. MEDIUM: (Deeper logic, multi-condition understanding)
=========================================================
4. In what situations would you combine and and or in the same expression, and how does Python decide which part to evaluate first
5. Why is logical not often used for toggling states such as system availability or access control
6. How can incorrect grouping using parentheses change the meaning of combined logical expressions

C. DIFFICULT: (Advanced reasoning + real engineering logic)
===========================================================
7. Explain how logical operators help implement complex decision systems such as loan approval, security checks, or workflow validation
8. Describe short-circuit evaluation in Python and how it optimizes logical AND/OR expressions in real applications
9. How do logical operators help build rule engines, access policies, or configuration systems that evaluate multiple conditions reliably
